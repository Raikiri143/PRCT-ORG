          <h3>The Value of our Network</h3>
          <p>
          PRCT Bank’s unparalleled international network covers countries accounting for approximately 90 per cent of global GDP, trade and capital flows. We have a leading presence in large and fast-growing economies, and our network covers all of the trade corridors forecast to be the world’s largest by 2030. These 30 corridors are expected to have a compound annual growth rate well in excess of GDP growth expectations from 2016 to 2030. 
            <br>
          We operate a balanced universal banking model across both wholesale and retail businesses and we are geographically diversified. This has resulted in a lower risk profile and lower earnings volatility compared with our global peers.</p>

          <h3>Targets</h3>
          <p>We aim to achieve a return on equity of more than 10 per cent in the medium term. We aim to grow business revenues faster than operating expenses on an adjusted basis. In the current uncertain environment, we plan to sustain the annual dividend in respect of the year at its current level for the foreseeable future. Growing our dividend will depend on the overall profitability of the Group, delivering further release of less efficiently deployed capital and meeting regulatory capital requirements in a timely manner. Actions to address these points were core elements of our Investor Update in June 2015.
            <br>
          Delivering these priorities will create value for our customers and shareholders and contribute to the long-term sustainability of PRCT Bank. In the process, we shall maintain a robust, resilient and environmentally sustainable business in which our customers can have confidence, our employees can take pride and our communities can trust.</p>

          <h3>PRCT Bank Loans</h3>
          <p>A good credit record is very valuable to you as this information is used by banks and finance companies when they are deciding whether to approve your application for a new loan or credit card, or when managing existing such as increasing your borrowing limit. 
<br>
<br>
It takes time to build up a good credit record. You can achieve this by: 
<ul>
  <li>Paying bills on time, not filing for bankruptcy, not having any court action taken against you for non-payment of debts </li>

<li>These all add to a good credit history. Long years of managing your finances well builds up and if you have a record of good up repayment, a lender is more likely to offer you a credit at lower rates of interest. This is because interest rates are based on how risky you are, and judgment about risk is based on credit history. </li>
<li>Treat your credit record like a precious commodity that's hard to replace once you lose it. You need to protect it carefully as it will affect your chances of getting a loan or credit card application approved when you really need it. Managing your financial affairs well will help you improve your credit record and your ability to achieve your dreams.</li> 
</ul> 
Good Credit History 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Easier access to credit, lower interest rates on loans </li>
  <li>Tells employers, banks and anyone who is considering entering into an agreement with you that you are trustworthy </li>
</ul>
Poor Credit History 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>  Harder to access credit products, higher interest rates, difficulty getting products like loans </li>
  <li>  Suggests to banks that you may not fulfill credit agreements </li>
  <li>May negatively affect your chances for future employment </li>
</ul>
No Credit History 
<br>
<ul>
  <li> No credit history is better than a poor credit history, however it may still be difficult to access credit</li>
  <li> As an alternative, lenders may look at regular payments, history of rent, utility bills, and other large expenses to see how
   you've managed your bills in the past</li>
</ul>
